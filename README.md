DNA is a program that identifies a person based on their DNA.

This is my conversion into Go of the Python program I wrote for Harvardx CS50P problem set 6, with added data validation and error handling. I also converted and adapted CS50's longest_match function. I reused the database and sequence files provided by CS50.
